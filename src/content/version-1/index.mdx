# Terminology

To better understand the documentation, here are some key terms you should know:

- **Composition:** The root object that contains all assets to be rendered in a single video.
- **Track:** A chronological sequence of clips of the same type (e.g., video clips).
- **Clip:** An object that contains specific rendering information, such as position and duration of visibility within the video.
- **Framerate:** The rate at which frames are displayed, measured in frames per second (FPS). If not specified otherwise, Diffusion Studio uses a default frame rate of 30 FPS.
- **Encoder:** A tool that compresses the size of each frame within the sequence, using common codecs such as H.264/AVC1 or H.265/HEVC.

## Installation

```sh
npm i @diffusionstudio/core
```

Now you can start hacking!

## Enjoy!

```typescript
import { TextClip, Composition, Encoder } from '@diffusionstudio/core';

const text = new TextClip('Hello World');         // create text

const composition = new Composition();            // create root object
await composition.add(text);                      // render text

await new Encoder(composition).render(); // download
```
