# Animations

Diffusion Studio offers a Motion Canvas-like API for animating clips, making it an excellent choice when creating videos programmatically. However, if you're developing a video editing application, the traditional `Keyframe` based approach might be more suitable for providing users with familiar editing controls.

### Getting Started with the Animation API

You can access the Animation API by calling the `animate()` method on visual clips. Let's start by creating a text clip:

```typescript
const duration = composition.duration.frames;

const text = await composition.add(
  new core.TextClip({
    text: 'Hello World',
    position: 'center',
    fontSize: 34,
    stop: duration,
  })
);
```

<Callout title="Be Careful">Make sure that the composition already has a length. If the text is the first clip you add to the composition, its length is 0 and you are 
assigning 0 to the stop attribute.</Callout>

### Adding Animations

Once you've created the clip, you can add animations like this:

```typescript
text.animate()
  .rotation(90).to(360 * 2, 15)
  .translateX(0, duration - 20, 'easeIn').to(-2000, 10)
  .scale(0.3).to(1, 10);
```

This example will:
- Rotate the clip from `90°` to `720°` over `15` frames.
- Translate the clip from the center to the left, starting `20` seconds before the end of the video, over a span of `10` frames.
- Scale the clip from `0.3x` to `1x` over `10` frames.

### Initial Value Animations with Delays

If the initial value method is called with a delay, the animation will start from the current value and animate to the specified value. For example:

```typescript
text.animate().alpha(0.5, 10);
```

Since the default alpha of a clip is `1`, this animation will reduce the alpha from `1` to `0.5` over `10` frames.

### Easing Functions

You can also specify an easing function as the third argument for smoother transitions. For example:

```typescript
text.animate().alpha(0.5, 10, 'easeOut');
```

### Complex Animations with Chained `to()` Methods

For more intricate animations, you can chain multiple `to()` methods. Here's an example:

```typescript
text.animate().alpha(0.5).to(0.8, 10).to(0.3, 10);
```

> **Note:** The frame count in each `to()` method is relative to the previous keyframe. In this example, the alpha value will change to 0.8 after 10 frames, and then to 0.3 after another 10 frames.
