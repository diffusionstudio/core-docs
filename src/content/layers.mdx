# Layers

Layers serve as an abstraction layer in Diffusion Studio, providing three key functionalities:

1. **Efficient Clip Rendering:** Layers determine which clips will be rendered, enabling the software to bypass unnecessary iterations over non-visible clips. Only visible clips within the layer are processed.

2. **Layering Control:** Layers define the layering order of visible elements. The `Layer` at index 0 will be rendered last, meaning it appears on top of other layers.

3. **Clip Management:** Layers manage the clips' lifecycle, including initialization, adding, removing, and updating clips.

### Layer Creation

```typescript
import * as core from '@diffusionstudio/core';

const layer = new core.Layer();
```

You can now add clips to the layer, but it's important to note that clips cannot overlap.

```typescript
await layer.add(
  new core.TextClip({
    text: 'Hello',
    delay: 0, // Default delay
    duration: 30,
  })
);

await layer.add(
  new core.TextClip({
    text: 'World',
    delay: 30,
    duration: 60,
  })
);
```

If clips overlap, Diffusion Studio will automatically adjust the start/stop times or move the clip to a different layer. The `add` method is asynchronous because Diffusion Studio waits until the clip is fully initialized before adding it to the layer.

You can render a layer by adding it to a composition:

```typescript
const composition = new core.Composition();

await composition.insertLayer(layer);
```

> By calling `layer.remove(clip)` you can remove a `Clip` from the `Layer`

### Sequential Mode

Layers can also be configured to operate in *sequential mode*, which ensures that each new clip added starts exactly where the previous clip ended (plus 1 millisecond). Sequential mode can be enabled as follows:

```typescript
layer.sequential(); // disable with layer.sequential(false);
```

### Layering

Let's set up an example to illustrate how tracks are layered:

```typescript
// alterantive approach for creating tracks 
// and adding them to the composition
const video = await composition.createLayer(); 
const image = await composition.createLayer();
const text = await composition.createLayer();
```

When a layer is added to the composition it will be added to `position 0` and rendered last. When visualized the text layer will be rendered on top of the image layer, which will be rendered on top of all `VideoClip`s inside the video layer.

Each `Layer` implements the `index` method which can be used to change the order. It accepts an index or `top | bottom`:

```typescript
video.index(0);
```

Now the video layer will be rendered on top of all other layers.
