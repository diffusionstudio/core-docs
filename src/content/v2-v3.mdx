# Migration Guide: v2.x to v3.x

## Time Unit Updates

All time units that previously required a number representing frames at 30FPS have been extended to support various formats:

- `2ms`, `2s`, `2f` (frames at 30FPS), `3.5min`, `2:35` (MM\:SS), `4:32:12` (HH\:MM\:SS), `3` (frames), `Timestamp`

## Media Clip Removal

The `MediaClip` type has been removed. Use `AudioClip` instead:

```diff
- MediaClip
+ AudioClip
```

## Track Type Changes

Typed tracks have been unified into a single type (`Track` instead of `VideoTrack`). Additionally, all `Track` references have been renamed to `Layer`:

```diff
- composition.createTrack(type);
+ composition.createLayer();

- composition.insertTrack(layer, index);
+ composition.insertLayer(layer, index);

- composition.findTracks();
+ composition.layers.find();

- composition.tracks;
+ composition.layers;
```

## Stacked Mode Renamed to Sequential

```diff
- track.stacked();
+ layer.sequential();
```

## New Getter for Layer Type

A new getter has been added to retrieve the type of the layer, determined by the first clip added:

```diff
+ layer.type;
```

## Retrieving Top-Level Clips

A new getter has been introduced to retrieve clips at the top level:

```diff
+ composition.clips;
```

The `findClips` method has been removed in favor of the new getter:

```diff
- composition.findClips();
+ composition.clips.find();
```

## Source Creation Changes

All types of sources are now created using `Source.from`:

```diff
- await VideoSource.from();
+ await Source.from<VideoSource>();
```

## Caption Creation Changes

Captions are now created at the top level and can be generated using just the transcript:

```diff
- audioClip.createCaptions();
- audioTrack.createCaptions();
+ composition.createCaptions(audioClip | transcript);
```

## Video Rendering Context Renamed

```diff
- renderer.ctx;
+ renderer.context;
```

## Transcript Function Update

The `Transcript.fromJSON()` method now also accepts objects:

```diff
- Transcript.fromJSON();
+ Transcript.from();
```

## Animation Keyframe Property Renamed

The `frame` property in animations has been renamed to `time`:

```diff
- keyframe.frame;
+ keyframe.time;
```

### Keyframe Structure Update

Previously, keyframes were structured as follows:

```json
{
    "key": "scale",
    "frames": [
        { "frame": 0, "value": 0.3 },
        { "frame": 10, "value": 1 }
    ]
}
```

Now, the structure has changed:

```json
{
    "key": "scale",
    "frames": [
        { "time": 0, "value": 0.3 },
        { "time": 10, "value": 1 }
    ]
}
```

## Composition Audio Method Removed

The `composition.audio` method has been removed:

```diff
- composition.audio();
```

## Source Attribute Changes

The `source.added` attribute has been removed. Use `source.data.added = true` instead:

```diff
- source.added;
+ source.data.added = true;
```
