# Terminology

To better understand the documentation, here are some key terms you should know:

- **Composition:** The root object that contains all assets to be rendered in a single video.
- **Layer:** A chronological sequence of clips of the same type (e.g., video clips).
- **Clip:** An object that contains specific rendering information, such as position and duration of visibility within the video.
- **Framerate:** The rate at which frames are displayed, measured in frames per second (FPS). If not specified otherwise, Diffusion Studio uses a default frame rate of 30 FPS.
- **Encoder:** A tool that compresses the size of each frame within the sequence, using common codecs such as H.264/AVC1 or H.265/HEVC.
- **Video Renderer:** An abstraction responsible for creating and managing the visual rendering context (WebGL or Canvas), drawing the composition state to the screen.
- **Audio Renderer:** Manages the playback of the composition and processes the audio data.

## Time Units
When working with time units, you can use the following formats:

- `2ms`, `2s`, `2f` (frames @30FPS), `3.5min`, `2:35` (MM:SS), `4:32:12` (HH:MM:SS), `3` (@30FPS), `Timestamp`

That's enough theoretical background. Now lets start hacking!

## Enjoy!

```typescript
import * as core from '@diffusionstudio/core';

const text = new core.TextClip({
  text: 'Hello World', 
  position: 'center' 
}); 

const composition = new core.Composition();       // create root object
await composition.add(text);                      // render text

const blob = await new core.Encoder(composition).render();
```
