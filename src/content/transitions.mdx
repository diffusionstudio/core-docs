# Transitions

Diffusion Studio supports a range of basic transitions that can be applied to `Clip` objects. To apply a transition, both `Clips` must be within the same `Layer`.

## Basic Transitions

### Fade Transition

The `Fade` transition provides a smooth fade-in and fade-out effect between clips.

```typescript
import * as core from '@diffusionstudio/core';

const layer = composition.createLayer().sequential();

await layer.add(
  new core.ImageClip('/image1.png', {
    height: '100%',
    duration: '3s',
    transition: {
      duration: '3s',
      type: 'dissolve',
    }
  })
);

await layer.add(
  new core.ImageClip('/image2.png', {
    height: '100%',
    duration: '3s',
  })
);
```

### Supported Transitions

The following transitions are available for use:

* `dissolve`: Creates a smooth fade between clips.
* `slide-from-right`: Slides the next clip from the right.
* `slide-from-left`: Slides the next clip from the left.
* `fade-to-black`: Fades the clip to black before transitioning.
* `fade-to-white`: Fades the clip to white before transitioning.
