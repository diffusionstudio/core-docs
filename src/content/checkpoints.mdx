# Checkpoints

Checkpoints allow you to save and restore the state of a composition, making it easy to manage complex projects efficiently.

## Basic Usage

To create a checkpoint, follow these steps:

```typescript
import * as core from '@diffusionstudio/core';

const composition = new core.Composition();

await composition.add(
  new core.ImageClip('/image1.png', {
    height: '100%',
  })
);

const checkpoint = await composition.createCheckpoint();
```

### Note

The checkpoint is JSON-serializable if the image clip is created from an image URL. If using blobs instead, the checkpoint will include the blob.

## Restoring a Checkpoint

To load a previously created checkpoint, use the following:

```typescript
const composition = new core.Composition();
await composition.restoreCheckpoint(checkpoint);
```

### Tip

Restoring a checkpoint multiple times is safe. The algorithm only updates differences between the current state and the checkpoint.

## Restoring Fonts

If your project uses custom fonts, ensure you restore them before restoring the composition.

### Creating a Font Checkpoint

```typescript
import * as core from '@diffusionstudio/core';

const fontManager = new core.FontManager();

const font = await fontManager.load({
  family: 'Geologica',
  weight: '800',
});

const fontCheckpoint = await fontManager.createCheckpoint();

const composition = new core.Composition();
const compositionCheckpoint = await composition.createCheckpoint();
```

### Restoring a Font Checkpoint

```typescript
const fontManager = new core.FontManager();
await fontManager.restoreCheckpoint(fontCheckpoint);

const composition = new core.Composition();
await composition.restoreCheckpoint(compositionCheckpoint);
```

### Important

Always restore the font manager before restoring the composition.

## Additional Information

Clips and Layers can also be restored from a checkpoint, providing flexibility when managing complex compositions.
